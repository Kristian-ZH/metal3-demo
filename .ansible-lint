# Ensure that the following ansible-lint rule failures are treated as
# warnings rather than errors.
warn_list:
  # We don't necessarily care about providing the galaxy_info settings
  # in our roles right now as they are currently for private/internal
  # use only.
  - meta-no-info  # meta/main.yml should contain relevant info.

  # ansible-lint complains that tasks which are triggered as a result of
  # another task having a changed status should be implemented as handlers.
  # However this is sometimes not possible (e.g. meta reset_connection
  # doesn't like running under a handler) or not desirable (e.g. if the
  # system packages have been updated or hostname has been changed we want
  # to trigger the reboot at the specific point in the play, before we
  # continue on to setup any services that may have been updated or freshly
  # installed.
  - no-handler  # Tasks that run when changed should likely be handlers.

# NOTE: To completely hide complaints about any of the above rules, rather
# than just converting them to non-fatal warnings, simply move them to a
# `skip_list` item instead.
